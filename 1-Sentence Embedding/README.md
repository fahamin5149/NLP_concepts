## Tokenizer Overview
The `tokenizer` is a tool that converts raw text into a format suitable for machine learning models, typically by splitting the text into smaller units called **tokens**. These tokens can be words, subwords, or characters, depending on the tokenizer's configuration. The tokenizer also maps these tokens to their corresponding numerical IDs, which are used as input for models.

### Key Features of tokenization:
1. **Tokenization**: Splits text into tokens.
2. **Encoding**: Converts tokens into numerical IDs.
3. **Special Tokens**: Adds special tokens (e.g., `[CLS]`, `[SEP]`) if required by the model.
4. **Padding and Truncation**: Ensures all sequences have the same length for batch processing.

## Parameters Explained

### `return_tensors="pt"`
- Specifies the format of the returned output.
- `"pt"` stands for PyTorch, meaning the output will be in the form of PyTorch tensors.


### `padding=True`
- **Padding** ensures that all sequences in a batch have the same length by adding special padding tokens (usually `[PAD]`) to shorter sequences.
- When `padding=True`, the tokenizer automatically pads sequences to the length of the longest sequence in the batch.

### `truncation=True`
- **Truncation** ensures that sequences longer than a specified maximum length are cut off (truncated) to fit.
- This is important because models often have a maximum input length (e.g., 512 tokens for BERT).

## Example Workflow
1. **Input Text**: `["Hello, world!", "How are you?"]`
2. **Tokenization**: Splits text into tokens (e.g., `["Hello", ",", "world", "!"]`).
3. **Encoding**: Converts tokens to IDs (e.g., `[101, 7592, 1010, 2088, 999, 102]`).
4. **Padding**: Adds padding tokens to shorter sequences to match the longest sequence.
5. **Truncation**: Cuts off tokens from sequences longer than the model's max length.
6. **Output**: Returns a dictionary of PyTorch tensors (e.g., `{"input_ids": tensor(...), "attention_mask": tensor(...)}`).
